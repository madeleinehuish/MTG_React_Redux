### React Practice Website

https://radiant-stream-78248.herokuapp.com/

Although appearing simple, this app was built with many technologies, including react, redux to manage state (including async middlewares for api calls), react-router, higher order components to help with re-rendering, css modules for styling, node/express server with routing, mongo database, modern es6 syntax and heroku build & deployment with client and server.

After signing in or signing up, the app will take you to a page where you can call up the current food trucks available in San Francisco through one of SF's city apis. I got the idea of this from a command line app I built months ago for an interview.

I will probably continue to build on the application to continue practicing my React/Redux skills.
