### React Practice Website

https://radiant-stream-78248.herokuapp.com/

I built the skeleton for this app following a template that I built with the help of a tutorial by Stephen Grider on Udemy. I have already expanded some of the basic functionality and plan to build it out more to practice react/redux skills. I have greatly improved the original app through styling, more redux actions/reducers, production modes, and more.

Although appearing simple, this app utilizes many technologies, including react, redux to manage state (including async middlewares for api calls), css modules for styling, mongo database, modern es6 syntax and heroku build & deployment with client and server.

After signing in or signing up, the app will take you to a page where you can call up the current food trucks available in San Francisco through one of SF's city apis. I got the idea of this from a command line app I built months ago for an interview.

I will probably continue to build on the application to continue practicing my React/Redux skills.
